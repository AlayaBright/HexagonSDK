* Try it:

0. Update CMAKE_ROOT within the first few lines in cmake_configure.bash to point to the installed cmake directory on your system.

On windows, within the same shell:
1. Goto hexagon SDK root and run "setup_sdk_env.cmd"
2. Go to source directory of the example and run .\cmake_build.cmd <OPTIONS>

On Linux:
1. Goto hexagon SDK root and do "source setup_sdk_env.source"
2. Go to source directory of the example and run "./cmake_build.bash" <OPTIONS>

Usage:
    cmake_build.cmd/bash <action> [Options]

    action:

    hexagon                                                              => Build a dynamic DSP lib .so
    hexagonsim                                                           => Build a dynamic DSP lib or executable for hexagon and run on simulator
    android                                                              => Build the android executable
    V=<valid make.d build ID>                                            => Build as with make.d

    Hexagon Options ( * denotes defaults ):

    BUILD=<*ReleaseG/ Debug>                                             => Build Variant
    DSP_ARCH=<*v65/v66,v68>                                              => Target Variant
    NO_QURT_INC=<*0/1>                                                   => Do not include QuRT as a dependency when NO_QURT_INC=1

    Android Options ( * denotes defaults ):

    BUILD=<*ReleaseG/ Debug>                                             => Build Variant
    HLOS_ARCH=<32/*64>                                                   => Android architecture variant

    Some common usage examples:

    ./cmake_build.bash hexagonsim                                        => builds binary for hexagon target and runs on simulator
    ./cmake_build.bash hexagon                                           => builds <example>_skel.so
    ./cmake_build.bash android                                           => builds android target related files
    ./cmake_build.bash V=android_ReleaseG_aarch64                        => Builds ReleaseG variant of android for 64-bit arch
    ./cmake_build.bash V=hexagon_Debug_toolsv84_v66                      => Builds Debug variant of hexagon target V66 using Hexagon tools version 8.4.*
    ./cmake_build.bash android BUILD=ReleaseG HLOS_ARCH=32               => Builds ReleaseG variant of android for 32-bit arch
    ./cmake_build.bash hexagon BUILD=Debug DSP_ARCH=v68                  => Builds Debug variant of hexagon target V68 to run on top of QURT
    ./cmake_build.bash hexagon BUILD=Debug DSP_ARCH=v68 NO_QURT_INC=1    => Builds baremetal Debug variant of hexagon target V68
    ./cmake_build.bash V=hexagon_Debug_dynamic_toolv84_v66               => Builds Debug variant of hexagon target V66
    ./cmake_build.bash V=hexagon_ReleaseG_dynamic_toolv84_v66            => Builds ReleaseG variant of hexagon target V68

Tech notes:

1. Hexagon_Toolchain.cmake. The main toolchain set up file for Hexagon tool chain and also define the
Compiler/linker options. Currently we are supporting the V65 and above hexagon versions and the v84 toolchain version.

2. hexagon_fun.cmake.  Helper functions to help both Android side and
Hexagon side to set up target dependency, include path and library
dependencies.


Interfaces & Usage case:

interfaces for now:

1. prepare_libraries_hexagon (<hexagon_targets> <hexagon_incs>  <hexagon_libs> libName [libNames...])

    Rationale:

    This hexagon helper function will return (1) A target for all dependent
    libraries (2) a include list (3) a library list.  So that you can put them
    into corresponding part in your target/lib/inc dependencies.

    We can always add the hexagon targets as the dependencies of your
    specified target. But that's less flexible, as you might want to have two
    of your target depends on the same "hexagon" target

    ##############################
    #
    # prepare_libraries_hexagon (<hexagon_targets> <hexagon_incs>  <hexagon_libs>
    #   libName [libNames...])
    #
    # The first 3 arguments will be the output arguments.  And the
    # following arguments will be the library names.  Without surfix, it is
    # treated as a dynamic library. Surfixed with ".a" will be processed as
    # static library. And surffixed with ".so" will be processed as dynamic
    # library.
    #
    # This function will do the following:
    #
    # (1) For all libraries that specified, it will search Hexagon SDK tree
    # to find the corresponding library, and add a target into the
    # <hexagon_targets> list.  The custom_target will specify what to do
    # for that target.  It can be going into that corresponding directory to
    # build the directory or do nothing if it's prebuilt library. Caller of
    # this function can add this target as the dependency of their own
    # target or multiple targets
    #
    # (2) This call will add the "library specific" include directories
    # into <hexagon_incs> list. Caller of the function can add this include
    # path list into their corresponding include list
    #
    # (3) This library call will also return a "library-target" list
    # <hexagon_libs> so that it can be added into the linker dependency
    # list from target_link_libraries call
    #
    ##############################
    prepare_libraries_hexagon(hexagonTargets_1 hexagonIncs_1 hexagonLibs_1
        adsprpc
        )

    # Step 1: Add hexagonIncs as part of your includes
    include_directories(
        ${incs}
        ${hexagonIncs_1}
        )
    # Step 2: Add hexagonTargets as one of your dependencies
    add_dependencies(benchmark ${hexagonTargets_1})

    # Step 3: Add hexagonLibs as your target link dependency

2. buildIDL (<idlFile> <currentTaget>)

    ##############################
    #
    # buildIDL (<idlFile> <currentTaget>)
    #
    # This function will set up a custom_target to build <idlFile> using qaic
    # IDL compiler. For foo.idl, it wll generate foo.h, foo_stub.c and
    # foo_skel.c into ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR} diretory.
    #
    # This function will also add the custom_target created as the dependency
    # of <currentTarget>
    #
    ##############################
    buildIDL( inc/benchmark.idl benchmark incs)


3. runHexagonSim (<targetToRunOnSimulator>)

    ##############################
    #
    # runHexagonSim (<targetToRunOnSimulator>)
    #
    # This fuction will help create a target to run simulator on the target
    # specified from the argument
    #
    # You can update <HEXAGON_EXEC_SIM_OPTIONS> to customized the options for
    # simualtor
    #
    # You can also update <HEXAGON_EXEC_CMD_OPTIONS> to customized the options
    # for executable
