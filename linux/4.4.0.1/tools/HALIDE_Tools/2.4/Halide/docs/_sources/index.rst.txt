####################################################

This document describes usage of Halide for the Qualcomm\ |reg| Hexagon\ |TM| DSP, in
particular, its vector coprocessor called Qualcomm\ |reg| Hexagon\ |TM| Vector
eXtensions (HVX).

Halide is a Domain Specific programming language (DSL), a dialect of C++. It is
used to author efficient and feature-rich image processing and computational
photography applications.

Qualcomm Halide for HVX allows developers to utilize features of the HVX processor
without knowledge of the underlying HVX architecture. It also supports offloading
the workload to the Hexagon DSP on Qualcomm\ |reg| Snapdragon\ |TM| devices.
