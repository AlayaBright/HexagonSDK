Hexagon LLVM Tools Release version 8.4.12 - Release Notes

----------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Overview ####
- Overview
- General
- Requirements
- Known Issues
- Changes
- Notices

#### General ####

The Hexagon LLVM Tools Release version 8.4 is the first release with
support for Hexagon v68 and v68 HVX architecture. Hexagon Architectures
supported in this release include V62, V62 HVX, V65, V65 HVX, V66,
V66 HVX, V67, V67t, V68 and V68 HVX

This release is based on LLVM.org enhanced with optimizations from the
Qualcomm LLVM team.  As a cross compiler, it runs on x86-64 Linux or
Windows host and generates code for Hexagon targets.

Notes:

LLDB:
- Linux LLDB is built with Python 2.7.8.
- Windows LLDB is built with Python 3.5.1.
- LLDB will ignore the PYTHONHOME variable, and use PYTHONPATH as expected.
- To use LLDB with booter, define the environment variable
  LLDB_HEXAGON_BOOTER_PATH with the path to the booter (bootimg.pbn,
  runelf.pbn, etc.) executable. Load the
  target to debug in LLDB. When you run the program, LLDB will launch
  hexagon-sim with the correct flags to run your target under booter.
- By default, LLDB launches hexagon-sim from <install>/Tools/bin. If you wish
  to use a different hexagon-sim, define LLDB_HEXAGON_SIM_PATH with the path
  to the simulator binary you wish to use.

Please send all support questions and bug reports to your local
Qualcomm Hexagon Customer Support office.

#### Requirements ####
  Minimum memory requirement: 16Gbytes RAM

Windows:
- Microsoft Windows Server 2008 R2 or newer, Windows 8, and Windows 10.
- 64 bit versions are required.
- If you are compiling cosims, you should use MSVC 2015 to ensure
  compatibility with the simulator.

Linux:

- 64 bit installation of SuSe Linux Enterprise 11 SP3 or newer, or Ubuntu
  14.04 or newer.
- Ubuntu 14.04 requires updates. These commands will
  normally be adequate to install them:
    sudo apt-get install python-software-properties
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install gcc-4.8
    sudo apt-get install g++-4.8
    sudo apt-get install libc6 libc6-dev

#### Known Issues / Limitations ####

LLDB:
- Windows command line editing is not as advanced due to absence of
  libedit.  It is on par with a cmd shell.

C++11/14:
- Full compliance for C++11/14 is dependent on support from QuRT.

C++17:
- Parallelism TS is not yet supported upstream in libc++.
- constexpr std::hardware_ {constructive,destructive} is implementation dependent.
- Filesystem is an optional C++17 feature.
    See https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/filesystem:
    "The filesystem library facilities may be unavailable if a hierarchical file system is not accessible to the implementation, or if it does not provide the necessary capabilities."
